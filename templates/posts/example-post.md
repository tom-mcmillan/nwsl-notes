# Example NWSL Post: How to Structure Your Content

This is an example post showing the proper structure for nwsldata Substack articles.

## Introduction

Start with a compelling hook that draws readers in. State what you'll cover and why it matters.

**Key points to establish:**
- The main topic
- Why it's timely/relevant
- What readers will learn

## Main Content Section

Break your content into logical sections with clear headers.

### Subsection: Using Data

When presenting statistics:

1. **Context first**: Explain what the metric measures
2. **Show the numbers**: Present clean, readable data
3. **Interpret**: Tell readers what it means

Example data presentation:

| Player | Goals | xG | Difference |
|--------|-------|----|-----------|
| Player A | 12 | 9.5 | +2.5 |
| Player B | 8 | 10.2 | -2.2 |
| Player C | 10 | 9.8 | +0.2 |

### Subsection: Adding Visuals

Reference images like this:

*Caption: Always add descriptive alt text for accessibility*

## Analysis Section

This is where you dive deeper:

- **What the data shows**: Surface-level observations
- **What it means**: Deeper interpretation
- **Why it matters**: Implications for teams, players, league

> Use blockquotes for important takeaways or quotes

## Lists for Readability

**Numbered lists** for sequential items:
1. First point
2. Second point
3. Third point

**Bullet lists** for non-sequential items:
- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

## Code Blocks for Technical Content

If sharing queries or code:

```python
# Example: Calculate xG difference
xg_diff = actual_goals - expected_goals
overperformance = xg_diff > 0
```

Or for showing data:

```
Total Shots: 487
Shots on Target: 234 (48%)
Goals: 45 (9.2% conversion)
```

## Emphasis and Formatting

- Use **bold** for key terms or emphasis
- Use *italics* sparingly for subtle emphasis
- Use `inline code` for stats or technical terms: `xG = 2.3`

## Links

Add context with links to [other resources](https://example.com) or previous posts.

## Conclusion

Wrap up with:
- Summary of key findings
- Implications for the future
- Call to action (engage in comments, etc.)

## Metadata Tips

Your frontmatter tags should:
- Include `nwsl` as base tag
- Add content type: `analysis`, `preview`, `recap`, `data`
- Add subjects: `players`, `teams`, `tactics`, `stats`
- Keep to 3-5 tags total

Example tag combinations:
- `[nwsl, analysis, players, stats]`
- `[nwsl, preview, teams, tactics]`
- `[nwsl, data, historical, comparison]`
