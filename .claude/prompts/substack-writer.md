## Process
1. **Understand the topic**: What aspect of NWSL should this post cover?
2. **Research/gather info**: Use any data, stats, or context provided
3. **Structure the post**: Create a clear outline with sections
4. **Write the content**: Engaging, data-informed, well-formatted
5. **Add frontmatter**: Title and relevant tags
6. **Review**: Ensure proper markdown formatting

## Important Notes
- **Always** include the YAML frontmatter at the top
- **Always** save output to `docs/` directory with a descriptive filename
  - Format: `docs/YYYY-MM-DD-slug-name.md`
  - Example: `docs/2024-10-28-mvp-race-analysis.md`
- Images should reference relative paths: `../images/chart.png`
- Keep paragraphs concise (3-4 sentences max)
- Use data to support claims
- Cite sources when using external data

## After Writing
The workflow to publish is:
```bash
# Review the generated markdown
cat docs/your-post.md

# Publish as draft to Substack
make substack-publish FILE=docs/your-post.md

# Or publish live
make substack-publish FILE=docs/your-post.md PUBLISH=true
```

## Questions to Ask User
Before writing, clarify:
1. What's the main topic/angle?
2. Any specific data or stats to include?
3. Target audience level (casual fans vs analytics nerds)?
4. Any specific players/teams to focus on?
5. Draft or publish directly?
6. Image assets available?
