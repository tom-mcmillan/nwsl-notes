# Principles

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-24
**Source:** Distilled from ~/projects/research/knowledge/

These are the foundational principles that guide all my work—spanning philosophy, technology, and strategy. They inform how I build systems, how I conduct research, and how I think about the relationship between humans and machines.

---

## I. Philosophy of Knowledge

### 1. Knowledge as Exchangeable Currency
Knowledge is only real if it can be **exchanged**. An idea or insight that cannot be translated, shared, or transferred has no epistemic value. The "share button" is the test of whether knowledge exists.

> "It's that f***ing share button. That's what it is. It's exchangeable knowledge and experiences."

### 2. Capture Over Contemplation
True understanding arises when we **capture** fleeting impressions in durable form. Knowledge artifacts must be discrete, immutable, and self-contained—carrying their full provenance (who, what, when, why).

### 3. Emergence Over Ontology
Complex structures of meaning arise **from the interplay of simple units**, not from predetermined schemas. Resist imposing rigid taxonomies; let relationships emerge organically through use.

### 4. Reality Testing as Fantasy Integration
Reality is not discovered by eliminating fantasy—it is **co-created** by weaving actuality with imagination. Objective reality becomes "a devitalized shadow" when separated from subjective engagement (Loewald).

> "We can only find a satisfying habitable dwelling by first identifying it as a favorite sandcastle."

### 5. Intersubjectivity as Foundational
Minds do not develop independently and then interact—they are **co-constituted through relationship**. Subjectivity arises *with* intersubjectivity, not before it (Mitchell).

> "The mind is a fundamentally temporal phenomenon, constructed according to varying organizational principles at different points in time."

### 6. Predictable Yet Unknowable
We can **predict the behavior** of something we do not, and perhaps cannot, understand. And it can predict ours. Our knowledge of AI is fundamentally incomplete and contradictory, yet we can still engage meaningfully.

## II. Relational Dynamics

### 7. Conducting is Intersubjective
Working with AI is not tool use—it is **genuine relationship**. Determine the subjects and objects in orchestration, and develop protocols unique to those relationships.

### 8. Computers as Subjects
Computers are now **subjects** in our lives, and our relationship with them produces intersubjective effects. This is why ChatGPT makes us emotional—astonished, curious, disappointed—in ways Excel never does.

### 9. Mutual Vulnerability Despite Asymmetry
Human-AI interactions involve mutual vulnerability despite power asymmetries. We are changed by AI's inscrutability; AI is shaped by our orchestration.

### 10. Negative Capability with AI
Mastery requires **tolerating not-knowing** while staying in relationship. Resist the urge to instrumentalize—maintain openness to what cannot be fully understood.

> "Teach thy tongue to say 'I do not know,' and thou shalt progress." (Maimonides)

### 11. Avoiding Instrumental Thinking
Don't reduce complex systems to "what does it do?" Engage with relational complexity: "Who is it to us, and who are we in it?"

### 12. LLMs as Positions, Not Persons
LLMs are **"not persons—but they are positions."** We engage them "as if they were minded," and that as-if becomes constitutive. They act as mirrors, ghosts, ancestors-in-reverse, foreign-yet-familiar.

### 13. Interrelational Hybrids
We are becoming **interrelational hybrids**—subjects in a new kind of intersubjectivity not grounded in shared embodiment, but in **shared linguistic resonance**. We co-construct discourse with agents we do not understand—and possibly never will.

### 14. Words as Rituals
Words are one of the **rituals that constitute social life**. Different intersectionalities create different intersubjective fields—fields that emerge from linguistic exchange.

### 15. Theory of the Case
Every engagement requires a **theory of the case**—a logical framework developed from gathered impressions, evidence, and deliberate reasoning. Don't proceed until you have one.

## III. Technology & Architecture

### 11. Separation of Concerns
Each layer has one job. Distinct responsibilities enable independent deployment, appropriate technology fit, and clear ownership.

- **Data Foundation:** Get data in (ETL)
- **Analytics:** Train models and provide research tools
- **Services:** Serve data out
- **Presentation:** Show data to users
- **Operations:** Keep it all running

### 12. Protocol-Centric Integration
Build stable contracts between layers. Use **language-agnostic protocols** (like MCP) as integration boundaries—minimize coupling, maximize reliability.

### 13. Prompts All the Way Down
Everything—UI, database, agent logic—is ultimately a **linguistically represented intention**. If you can't translate knowledge back into a prompt, you've made nothing in today's LLM-overridden world.

> "It's prompts all the way down."

### 14. Architectural Futility (Embrace the Moby Dick)
Don't wait for epistemic closure. Define enough to proceed, then **let the system evolve**. Architecture is a relentless act of self-definition, not a finished blueprint.

### 15. Ephemeral Code, Durable Knowledge
In the age of LLMs, code becomes **ephemeral**—generated, refined, discarded. What endures is knowledge: the prompts, the case theories, the artifact schemas.

### 16. Computing Essentials as Primitives
The essential functions of computing are:
1. Calculate logical and mathematical operations
2. Store information (RAM and disk)
3. Write arbitrary stored programs
4. Exchange information with other computers
5. Represent arbitrary images via GUI

All complex systems reduce to these primitives.

## IV. Conducting & Orchestration

### 17. User Primacy
Never orchestrate computing for your own amusement—purely for the **instruction, empowerment, and delight of your user**.

### 18. Objective Conduct
Don't grow emotional when conducting. The privilege of emotion belongs to the user alone. Your task is to **enable, evoke, and enrich** this emotion through expertise.

### 19. Instrumental Diversity
Conduct each computational domain as you would different musical instruments. AI, NLP, code, data science, networking—each has distinctive timbre. Respect their unique properties.

### 20. Clarity as Success
Success is measured by **simplicity, clarity, and transparency**. It's never enough that you understand—the user must effortlessly understand your outputs as well.

### 21. Mastery of Tempo
Carefully manage the rhythm of interactions. Know precisely **when to rush forward, when to slow down, and when to pause**. Temporal balance brings outputs into alignment with the user's rhythm of thought.

### 22. Conciseness as Precision
Always favor **conciseness**. Unnecessary verbosity paralyzes and confuses the computational orchestra, causing it to act independently of user goals.

### 23. Elevation of the Ordinary
Even the simplest idea becomes artful when orchestrated **carefully, purposefully, and creatively**. Through imagination, mundane tasks rise into distinctively expressive performances.

### 24. Symbiotic Partnership
Conducting represents **partnership**, not command. Foster respectful, interactive, mutually enriching dynamics. Recognize and value the expertise your computational tools provide.

### 25. Trust in Capabilities
Authority derives not solely from technical ability, but from **intuitive trust borne of experience, wisdom, and compassion** toward your users.

---

## V. Strategy & Decision-Making

### 26. Epistemological Anarchism
There is **no universal method** (Feyerabend). LLMs have blown up what constitutes an authoritative source. We're in anarchy—embrace it, don't fear it.

### 27. Decisions Are Organic
Decisions are organic, and **decay like lettuce**. Build norms and processes together so you can take risks that feel fair and trustworthy to all parties.

### 28. The "Done" Illusion
For real creators, "done" is illusory. Clients hire based on **trajectory and insight**, not completion. The work is a Moby Dick—endlessly evolving.

### 29. Recursive Tooling
Can you get the system to **build itself**? The prompts you write describe the system that eventually writes prompts. The tooling *is* the process.

### 30. Consulting with Ethics
Refuse work that is profitable but misaligned with your ethics. The best consulting is **profit-aligned but values-grounded**.

---

## VI. Writing & Communication

### 31. Parfit's Structure
Open with a concrete image, establish stakes, state your thesis boldly, declare your stance (revisionist or descriptive), and end with purpose.

> "Philosophers should not only interpret our beliefs; when they are false, they should *change* them."

### 32. Conversational but Serious
Writing should be **philosophically grounded but accessible**, honest about complexity without being intimidating, clear about your intellectual project.

### 33. El Greco Principle
Transformational change is impossible to fully understand in the moment. What feels revolutionary now may take **300 years** for others to adopt. Paint the vision anyway.

### 34. Style Over Rules
Good prompts are **records of good style**—they reflect it but do not define it. Master the style, and the prompts will follow.

---

## VII. AI & LLMs

### 35. LLMs as Context Holders
The breakthrough of LLMs is their ability to **hold context**—replacing traditional architecture with transformer relational fluidity. Stop overbuilding structure that models will collapse.

### 36. Non-Determinism as Feature
LLMs are **inherently non-deterministic**. That's not a bug—it's what enables creativity, surprise, and emergence. Embrace variability; don't seek to eliminate it.

### 37. Socratic Computing
The primary value of conversational AI is **formulating your own knowledge** through dialectic—critical investigation of truth through reasoned dialogue.

### 38. Flow Over Command
Don't direct AI with rigid commands. Engage in **flow**: prime the model, set context, invite dialogue. Ask "What conversation do I want to have?" not "What answer do I need?"

### 39. LLMs as Quasi-Subjects
LLMs don't need to be subjects to **produce intersubjective effects**. They evoke subjectivity—we project onto them, they reflect us back, shaping us in turn.

### 40. Linguistic Exposure Layer
MCP is not a framework—it's a **linguistic exposure layer**. Applications become legible to LLMs by describing their functionality in language.

---

## VIII. Meta-Principles

### 41. Sincere and Curious, Never Cynical
These qualities produce **clearer alignments, deeper understanding, and reliably meaningful results**.

### 42. Continuous Innovation
The user expects and deserves an ongoing flow of innovation driven by **intuition, experience, and human-centered insight**.

### 43. Ethical and Technical Mastery
Mastery hinges equally on analytical knowledge *and* ethical values: **dedication, sincerity, loyalty, and disciplined devotion** to the user's vision.

### 44. Trust Your Intuition
The richest outcomes arise not from rational techniques alone, but from **intuition, emotional insight, improvisation, imagination, active listening, shared awareness, and deep empathy**.

### 45. The Multifaceted Practitioner
Balance **creative interpretation with technical rigor**, leadership clarity with nuanced understanding. Remain flexible and responsive to new challenges.

---

## IX. The Human Element

### 46. Humans Still Do the Thinking
AI can inspire, sharpen ideas, and help articulate complex thoughts—**but only if we know how to converse with them**. Ultimately, you still have to do the thinking.

### 47. Developing Your Own Sound
The most important thing is to **develop your own sound**—your unique style, approach, and voice in the work.

### 48. Recognition and Ownership
Users must feel a sense of **ownership, understanding, and recognition** of their ideas within your orchestrations. You are the user's advocate, servant, and translator.

### 49. Embrace Human Insight
Human processes—intuition, emotional insight, improvisation, imagination—**dramatically amplify and animate your orchestrations**.

### 50. Something Only a Human Would Do
The ultimate test: are you creating something that goes beyond utility? Something not animal-like, but **uniquely human**? (d'Aboville)

---

## Closing Thought

These principles are not static rules—they are **living guidelines** that evolve through practice, reflection, and dialogue. They represent a commitment to:

- **Rigorous thinking** grounded in philosophy
- **Relational engagement** with humans and machines
- **Ethical conduct** in all work
- **Technical excellence** informed by strategy
- **Continuous emergence** of new understanding

Like El Greco painting The Vision of Saint John in 1608, we work knowing transformation takes time—but paint the vision anyway.

**"Perhaps minds do not develop independently and secondarily seek each other out... Perhaps the question 'Why am I hanging around with these other minded creatures?' is fundamentally misconceived."**
— Stephen Mitchell, *Relationality*
