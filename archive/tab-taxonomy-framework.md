# NWSL Terminal Tab Taxonomy Framework

## Epistemological Foundation: Bertrand Russell's Theory of Knowledge

Knowledge is created through progressive stages of engagement with reality:

1. **Acquaintance** - Direct perception of particulars (sense-data)
2. **Description** - Understanding through relations and patterns
3. **Inference** - Logical deduction from known to unknown
4. **Application** - Justified true belief that guides action

Our tabs mirror this progression, taking users from **impression to knowledge** through discrete, experientially distinct stages.

## Why Each Tab is Experientially Distinct

### OBSERVE vs EXPLAIN
- **OBSERVE**: Numbers in tables → Factual acquaintance
- **EXPLAIN**: Patterns on pitch diagrams → Causal understanding
- **Different**: One shows *that* Orlando won; the other shows *how* they scored

### EXPLAIN vs PROJECT
- **EXPLAIN**: What patterns exist in past data → Descriptive
- **PROJECT**: What those patterns imply for future → Predictive
- **Different**: One reveals "Sophia Smith's xG has been 0.5/game"; the other says "She'll likely score 15+ goals this season"

### PROJECT vs APPLY
- **PROJECT**: Model outputs, forecasts → Passive reception
- **APPLY**: Hypothesis testing, scenario building → Active exploration
- **Different**: One tells you "Orlando will probably win"; the other lets you test "Do Orlando win more when it rains?"

## Visual & Technological Differentiation

| Tab | Primary Technology | Visual Language | Interaction Model | Knowledge Type |
|-----|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **OBSERVE** | Real-time tables | Numerical, structured | Scanning, monitoring | Facts |
| **EXPLAIN** | Spatial visualizations | Pitch diagrams, networks | Exploring, comparing | Patterns |
| **PROJECT** | ML models | Probability charts, trends | Receiving, interpreting | Forecasts |
| **APPLY** | Statistical tools | Hypothesis tests, custom queries | Testing, querying | Decisions |

## User Journey Examples

### Journalist (Marcus)
1. **OBSERVE**: "Orlando beat Kansas City 2-1" → *I know what happened*
2. **EXPLAIN**: Shot map shows Orlando had 1.8 xG vs KC's 0.9 → *I understand why they deserved to win*
3. **PROJECT**: Model shows Orlando has 73% playoff probability → *I can predict their season*
4. **APPLY**: Tests hypothesis "Does Orlando perform better at home?" (p<0.05, yes) → *I can write with statistical evidence*

Article: "Orlando's 2-1 victory wasn't lucky—their 1.8 xG to 0.9 shows dominance. With 73% playoff probability and a statistically significant home advantage (p<0.05), they're built for a deep run."

### Coach (Lisa)
1. **OBSERVE**: "My opponent scored 3 goals last match" → *I know the result*
2. **EXPLAIN**: Shot map shows all 3 goals came from left side → *I understand their pattern*
3. **PROJECT**: Model predicts they'll score 1.8 goals against us → *I foresee the challenge*
4. **APPLY**: Tests "Do they score less when we press high?" (p=0.02, yes) → *I have a game plan*

Strategy: Overload right side defensively, press high to disrupt their scoring pattern.

### Analyst (David)
1. **OBSERVE**: Monitors league-wide Point Shares leaderboard → *I track player value*
2. **EXPLAIN**: Visualizes VAEP patterns for top players → *I understand value sources*
3. **PROJECT**: Uses form trends to identify breakout candidates → *I spot rising stars*
4. **APPLY**: Runs cohort comparison "Are rookie forwards improving?" (ANOVA, p<0.01) → *I publish research*

Paper: "Statistical evidence shows NWSL rookie forwards improve significantly through their first season (F=12.4, p<0.01), suggesting effective developmental pathways."

## Tab Names: Final Recommendation

**OBSERVE → EXPLAIN → PROJECT → APPLY**

### Why These Names Win:

1. ✅ **Clear, direct verbs** - No business jargon
2. ✅ **Progressive journey** - Each builds on previous
3. ✅ **Distinct experiences** - Different tech, visuals, interactions
4. ✅ **Russell's epistemology** - Mirrors knowledge creation process
5. ✅ **User-centric** - Focuses on what user *does*, not what system provides
6. ✅ **Universal appeal** - Works for fans, journalists, coaches, analysts

### Subtle Indicators of Epistemic Progression

Each tab could have a subtitle showing the knowledge question:

- **OBSERVE** - *What happened*
- **EXPLAIN** - *Why it happened*
- **PROJECT** - *What will happen*
- **APPLY** - *What to do*

Or more poetic:

- **OBSERVE** - *Witness the game*
- **EXPLAIN** - *Understand the patterns*
- **PROJECT** - *Foresee the future*
- **APPLY** - *Make decisions*

## Philosophical Foundation

From Russell's *The Problems of Philosophy*:

> "We shall say that we have acquaintance with anything of which we are directly aware, without the intermediary of any process of inference or any knowledge of truths."

**OBSERVE** = Acquaintance with match results, standings, scores

> "We shall say that we have knowledge by description when we know that there is one and only one object satisfying a certain description, though the object itself is not directly known to us."

**EXPLAIN** = Knowledge by description of tactical patterns, causal mechanisms

> "All our knowledge, both knowledge of things and knowledge of truths, rests upon acquaintance as its foundation."

**PROJECT** = Inference from acquaintance + description to probable future states

> "The value of philosophy is, in fact, to be sought largely in its very uncertainty... Philosophy is to be studied, not for the sake of any definite answers to its questions, but rather for the sake of the questions themselves."

**APPLY** = Practical philosophy - using knowledge to answer user's own questions

---

## Success Metrics

Users successfully navigate the knowledge journey when they:

1. ✅ **OBSERVE**: Can cite current league facts without looking them up
2. ✅ **EXPLAIN**: Can explain *why* a team won beyond just the score
3. ✅ **PROJECT**: Can make informed predictions about future matches
4. ✅ **APPLY**: Can test their own hypotheses with statistical rigor
