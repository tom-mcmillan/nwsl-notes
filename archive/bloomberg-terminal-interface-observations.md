## Layout & Information Architecture

### Multi-Panel Design (8-10 simultaneous windows)
- **Top-left**: Price chart with candlesticks + volume bars for "DDOG US Equity"

## Visual Design Principles

### Color Coding for Instant Recognition

- ðŸŸ¢ **Green** = Buy signals, positive performance, filled orders
- ðŸ”´ **Red** = Sell signals, negative performance, alerts
- ðŸŸ  **Orange** = News, alerts, pending actions
- ðŸ”µ **Blue** = Highlighted selections, interactive elements
- âšª **White** = Primary data, prices, text

### Information Density
- Every pixel serves a purpose - zero wasted space
- Small fonts, tightly packed tables
- Abbreviations everywhere (NSDQ, ARCX, BATS, IEX)
- Multiple data points per row (price, volume, change %, time)

### Dark Theme Aesthetic
- Black background (#000 or very dark gray)
- High contrast text for readability
- Reduces eye strain during long sessions
- Professional, serious tone
